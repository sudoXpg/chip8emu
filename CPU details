CHIP-8

35 opcodes that are 2-byte sized
4K memory
15 general purpouse 8-bit registers
    16th is for carry flag
index register  (0x00 - 0xFFF)
PC              (0x00 - 0xFFF)

0x000-0x1FF - Chip 8 interpreter (contains font set in emu)
0x050-0x0A0 - Used for the built in 4x5 pixel font set (0-F)
0x200-0xFFF - Program ROM and work RAM

Drawing is done in XOR mode 
    and if a pixel is turned off as a result of drawing, 
        the VF register is set. This is used for collision detection.

screen has a total of 2048 pixels
    array that hold the pixel state (1 or 0)

two timer registers that count at 60 Hz
    When set above zero they will count down to zero

The systemâ€™s buzzer sounds whenever the sound timer reaches zero

system has 16 levels of stack
    in order to remember which level of the stack is used, you need to implement a stack pointer (sp).
